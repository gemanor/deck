^ The different is similar to authentication and authorization.
We use the passport as a form of idenity to authenticate that we are who we say we are.
We use the flight ticket as a form of authority to authorize us to board the plane.

|                        | Passport                     | Flight Ticket                            |

^ Let's look better on the differnce between authentication and authorization.

|                        | Authentication                              | Authorization                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |

^ What are all the advanced use cases we need with autehntication?

[.autoscale: true]
[.build-lists: true]

# Authentication Advanced Features

- Multi-factor authentication
- Single sign-on / Social login / Passwordless
- User / account management
- Session management
- User registration / UI flows / customizations
- Account verification / recovery
- Audit / reporting / analytics / compliance
- Third party integrations

---

^ No one develop those features from scratch, we use OSS or cloud products

### Director of DevRel @ Permit.io

#### Not an ethical hacker, zero awards winner, dark mode hater.

---

![fit 50%](media/authn_arch.png)

---

^ Everyone agrees this authorization pattern is a bad pattern

<br>
<br>

```js
function deleteUser(user_id) {
  let user = User.get(user_id);
  if (user.role === "admin") {
    user.delete();
  }
}
```

---

^ Problem 1: Every configuration change requires a code change.
The usual implementation of authorization in python is decorators with roles
The problem is our need to change the code for every time we need to add a new role or change the logic of the role.

```js
// Middleware
function rolesRequired(role) {
  return function (req, res, next) {
    if (req.user.role === role) {
      next();
    } else {
      res.status(403).send("Forbidden");
    }
  };
}

app.delete("/users/:id", rolesRequired("admin"), function (req, res) {
  let user = User.get(req.params.id);
  user.delete();
  res.send("User deleted successfully");
});
```

---

^ Problem 2: We need to support multiple permission models.
Another problem is where we need to support multiple permission models in our framework.
We need to change the code and it start to be a mess.

<br>

[.column]

```js
// Middleware
function rolesRequired(role) {
  return function (req, res, next) {
    if (req.user.role === role) {
      next();
    } else {
      res.status(403).send("Forbidden");
    }
  };
}

function permissionsRequired(permission) {
  return function (req, res, next) {
    if (req.user.permissions.includes(permission)) {
      next();
    } else {
      res.status(403).send("Forbidden");
    }
  };
}
```

[.column]

```js
// Business logic
app.delete(
  "/users/:id",
  rolesRequired("admin"),
  permissionsRequired("delete_user"),
  function (req, res) {
    let user = User.get(req.params.id);
    user.delete();
    res.send("User deleted successfully");
  }
);
```

---

^ Problem 3: Need for a data and conditions that are not part of the request - decorators are just not enought.

<br>

[.column]

```js
// Middleware
function rolesRequired(role) {
  return function (req, res, next) {
    if (req.user.role === role) {
      next();
    } else {
      res.status(403).send("Forbidden");
    }
  };
}
```

[.column]

```js
// Business logic
app.get(
  "/enable_workflow/:user_id",
  rolesRequired("admin"),
  function (req, res) {
    const { userId } = req.params;
    let user = User.get(userId);
    let tier = bs.getTier(userId);
    if (tier !== "paid") {
      res.status(403).send("User is not paid user");
    } else if (user.sms_enabled) {
      sms(user.phone_number, "Workflow is enabled");
      res.send("Workflow enabled successfully");
    }
  }
);
```

---

^ Problem 4: People are adding authorization logic in the business logic to support partial authorization.

<br>
<br>

```js
// Business logic
app.get(
  "/enable_workflow/:user_id",
  rolesRequired("admin"),
  permissionsRequired("enable_workflow"),
  function (req, res) {
    const { user_id } = req.params;
    let user = User.get(user_id);
    let step1 = workflow.run();
    let step2 = workflow.run();
    if (user.sms_enabled) {
      send_sms_to_list(user.phone_number, "Workflow is enabled");
    }
    res.send("Workflow enabled successfully");
  }
);
```

---

^ Problem 5: Testing is hard, we need multiple permissions for multiple environments.

[.header: alignment(left)]

<br>

### Staging

```js
// Business logic
app.get(
    "/enable_workflow/:user_id",
    rolesRequired("admin"),
    permissionsRequired("enable_workflow"),
    function (req, res) {
        const { user_id } = req.params;
        let user = User.get(user_id);
        let step1 = workflow.run();
        ...
);
```

[.column]

### Production

```js
// Business logic
app.get(
    "/enable_workflow/:user_id",
    rolesRequired("superadmin"),
    permissionsRequired("enable_workflow"),
    function (req, res) {
        const { user_id } = req.params;
        let user = User.get(user_id);
        let step1 = workflow.run();
        ...
);
```

---

^ Problem 6: Every new framework/language required a new implementation.

[.header: alignment(left)]

[.column]

### Express

```js
app.get('/my_view', [
    rolesRequired('admin'),
    permissionsRequired('app_name.can_edit')
], function (req, res) {
    // Your view logic here
    ...
});
```

[.column]

## Flask

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
login_manager = LoginManager(app)

class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self, id, role):
        self.id = id
        self.role = role

@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(user_id):
    return User(user_id, 'admin')

@app.route('/admin')
@login_required
def admin():
    if current_user.role != 'admin':
        abort(403)
    ...
```

---

^ Problem 7: No way to audit decisions. performance

<br>

```js
if (
  user.role === "admin" &&
  user.tier === "paid" &&
  user.sms_enabled &&
  user.phone_number
) {
  send_sms_to_list(user.phone_number, "Workflow is enabled");

Not scalable, usually used in low-performance appliances
