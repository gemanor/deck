^ Here's the main problems that make the connection work a complex task
1. The structure of the connection request is not clear, give example of the simplicity of making connection in the internet
2. Each part of the scructure has too many options to choose from
3. There's no time to waste when need to outreach someone
4. These three is making me hard to get the confidence

^ First complexity factor is the growing amounts of data we are processing in our applications

# [fit] Chaos, _Complexity_, Velocity, Confidence

^ Such amount of data making the decisions harder.
1. The amount of data we need to get decision of
2. The decision themselves are more complex

![inline fit](media/traffic_signs.png)

---

^ First, the internal roles that want to get more control in the application

# Application Code Stakeholders

![inline fit](media/users_now_and_then.png)

^ In software development, there is the same evolution to simplify complexity
- Machine Code
  - Imperative Languages
    - Design Patterns
    - Frameworks
      - Declarative Languages
        - Domain Specific Languages

# Chaos üëâ Structure

---

^ The first step in modeling, is understanding where we need permissions in our stack
- Admission - What a Developer Can Do?
- Infrastructure - What Services Can Do?
- Application
  - Data - What Data Can Application Users Access?
  - Application code - What Application Users Can Perform?
  - UI (feature flags) - What Application Users Can See?

# Authorization Layers

![inline fit](media/layers_of_authz.png)

---

^ First step to solve the structure problem, is to decouple policy from code

#Abstract Authorization Service Model

![fit inline](media/policy_hierarchy.png)

^ DDD is a great example of the need in a specific authorization domain

# Complexity üëâ Design Patterns

# Abstract Decision Components

![fit inline](media/decision_engine_componetns.png)

---

^ Third step, is to understand our needs. It could be binary gating or filtering

# Authorization Decision Types

![inline fit](media/binary_vs_filtering.png)

---

^ For binary gating most important thing to rememer, is that our enforcement point should keep the same format with the model we choose

# Binary Check Function

```javascript
check({ user }, { action }, { resource }, { context });
```

---

# Binary Check Function

```javascript
check({ user }, { action }, { resource }, { context });
```

```python
response = requests.post('http://host.docker.internal:8180/v1/is_authorized', json={
    "principal": f"User::\"{user}\"",
    "action": f"Action::\"{method.lower()}\"",
    "resource": f"ResourceType::\"{original_url.split('/')[1]}\"",
    "context": request.json
})
```

```js
const response = await fetch(
  "http://host.docker.internal:8180/v1/is_authorized",
  {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      principal: `User::\"${user}\"`,
      action: `Action::\"${method.toLowerCase()}\"`,
      resource: `ResourceType::\"${originalUrl.split("/")[1]}\"`,
      context: body,
    }),
  }
);
```

---

^ For filtering, the best option is to have a function for partial evaluation queries

[.code: alignment(left)]

# Partial Evaluation Flow

```js
permit (
    principal == PhotoApp::User::"stacey",
    action == PhotoApp::Action::"viewPhoto",
    resource
)
when { resource in PhotoApp::Account::"stacey" };
```

‚¨á‚¨á‚¨á

```js
evaluate("pictures", "staty", "viewPhoto");

```sql
SELECT *

ABAC

[.column]
![inline 30%](media/rebac_icon.png)

ReBAC

---

^ PBAC is the less recommended one for application
See the example of policy rules, when an actual data is evolving, it getting hard. PBAC works well when we are working only with the context of the request.

# Policy Based Access Control

‚úî No External Data Policies

```
allow developers to deploy to production only on weekends

deny developers from creating S3 buckets with the name "prod"

allow developers to create S3 buckets only if their name starts with "dev-"
```

<br>

‚úó External Data Policies

```
allow developers to deploy S3 buckets only if the next billing cycle is less than $100
```

---

^ RBAC pros and cons

# Role Based Access Control

- Leverage user roles to determine permissions
- Commonly used as a term for authorization
- Very simple to implement and audit
- Flexible to use in different domains
- Hard to consider external data in policies
- Limited granularity in resource permissions

---

^ RBAC is the most common one for application

![inline 100%](media/rbac_diagram.png)


---

^ ReBAC pros and cons

# Relationship Based Access Control

- Assign instance-level roles to users
- Leverage entity relationships to derive role permissions
- Built to support modern data models in efficient way
- Require centralized graph to calculate decisions
- Limited granularity in user and resource inspection

^ What is google Zanzibar? It's a paper that propose a new approach to model permissions in a graph

^ RBAC is the most common one for application

![inline 100%](media/rebac_diagram.png)


---

^ ABAC pros and cons

# Attribute Based Access Control

- Leverage entities' attributes to model permissions
- Use attribute conditions in the policies
- Most flexible structured policy model
- Complex to build and audit in imperative languages
- Usually used as extension to RBAC and ReBAC systems

RBAC, ReBAC, ABAC Modeling Example

#[fit] Confidence üëâ Domain-Specific Declarative Code

---

^ This is where policy languages comes to the rescue, explain why it is solving the problems

```typescript
// Users can edit their own info, admins can edit anyone's info
permit (
    principal,
    action,
    resource in HealthCareApp::InfoType::"accountinfo"
)
when {
    resource.subject == principal ||
    principal in HealthCareApp::Role::"admin"
};

//A patient may create an appointment for themselves, or an administrator can do it
permit (
    principal,
    action == HealthCareApp::Action::"createAppointment",
    resource
)
when {
    (context.referrer in HealthCareApp::Role::"doctor"  && resource.patient == principal) ||
    principal in HealthCareApp::Role::"admin"
};
```

---

^ So, we might solve the structure problem with proper architecture, but imperative code still getting complex

[.column]
- Performance

[.column]
- Maintainance

---

^ What are the option that we have today? I choose three languages that represent different approaches. OPA multi purpose language, Cedar for application-level, and OpenFGA for decisions evolve lot of data

[.header: alignment(center)]

<br>
![inline 65%](media/cedar.png)

## AWS<br>Cedar

[.column]
![inline 15%](media/openfga.mp4)

## OpenFGA

---

```haskell
allow {
    input.user.role == "viewer"
    validate_department(input.user, input.document)
    validate_classification(input.user.role, input.document.classification)
    validate_dynamic_rules(input.user, input.document)
}

validate_department(user, document) {
    user.department == document.department
}

validate_classification(user_role, doc_classification) {
    role_permissions[user_role][_] == doc_classification
}

validate_dynamic_rules(user, document) {
    dynamic_rules[_](user, document)
}
```

---

^ Now, that we are understanding the basics, let see how the different approaches of the policy languages are working. Let's start with OPA

# Open Policy Agent

- Started as a multi-purpose policy engine
- Using Rego as a policy language
- As part of their GTM, they are focusing on Kubernetes admission
- Works great for application-level authorization (<10 ms for decision)
- Hard to deal with large (>2gb) sets of data
- Need some tweak for efficient ReBAC support

---

^ Since OPA is multi purpose, it's the easiest one to enforce permissions on multiple domains

# OPA Multi Domain Support

![inline fit](media/opa_multi.png)

---

^ Here you can see how clear and stragiht forward is the Cedar code

```javascript
permit (
    principal == PhotoApp::User::"stacey",
    action == PhotoApp::Action::"viewPhoto",
    resource
)
when { resource in PhotoApp::Account::"stacey" };
```

---

^ Cedar is simpler than OPA, but do not support ReBAC in easy way and aim to be perfect for application level

# AWS Cedar

- Started as a language for application-level authorization
- Not like AWS IAM, it's a language that can be used in any application
- AWS released it as open source, but also offer it as a service (AVP)
- Use Dafny language to provide scientific proof for correctness and performance
- (Still) hard to deal with unstructured data - no real ReBAC support
- Faster option for ABAC decisions
- Support audit, static analysis, and partial evaluation out of box

---

^ OpenFGA do not support ABAC, but it's ReBAC configuration support policy as code

```yaml
model
  schema 1.1

type organization
  relations
    define member: [user] or owner
    define owner: [user]
    define repo_admin: [user, organization#member]
    define repo_reader: [user, organization#member]
    define repo_writer: [user, organization#member]

type repo
  relations
    define admin: [user, team#member] or repo_admin from owner
    define maintainer: [user, team#member] or admin
    define owner: [organization]
    define reader: [user, team#member] or triager or repo_reader from owner
    define triager: [user, team#member] or writer
    define writer: [user, team#member] or maintainer or repo_writer from owner

type team
  relations
    define member: [user, team#member]

type user
```

---

^ OpenFGA is the one on the list that combines the configuration as code approach with Policy as Graph that proposed in Google Zanzibar paper

# OpenFGA

- Open source implementation of Google Zanzibar that fit any scale
- Configured with JSON/YAML/DSL
- Need to deploy one centralized platform for decision making
- Backed and maintained by Auth0 and use by them for authorization
- Contain many application-specific features

---

^ So let's summarise the different approaches and platforms

[.header: alignment(center)]
