^ Authorization not

# The Auth Comfort Zone

[.header: alignment(left)]
[.column]
## Authentication üòå
_Verify who the user is_

```javascript
if (!user) {
    return;
}
```

[.column]
## Authorization üòî
_Check what a user can do_

```javascript
if (!allowed(
        user,
        action,
        resource
    )) {
    return;
}
```

---

^ Typical authorization journey - code samples
^ Jessie got the ticket, looked at their framework, he knows clean code, he implemented nice middleware that support annotations on the API endpoints with the roles, at the end of the sprint they support RBAC and everyone was happy.

```javascript
// Middleware
if (req.user.roles.indexOf(role) === -1) {
    return res.send(403);
}

// Endpoint
@authz('admin')
const Document = () => {
    ...
}
```

---

^ After another week, a new feature added, paid users. Beside of roles, now there is a cross-role concept of paid users, and Jessie need to add it to the RBAC. Not that hard, just support in multiple decorators.

```javascript
// Middleware
const hasRole = roles.filter((r) => (
    req.user.roles.indexOf(role) > -1
))
if (!hasRole) {
    return res.send(403);
}

// Endpoint
@authz('admin')
@authz('paid')
const Document = () => {
    ...
}
```

---

^ But the week after, the PM come and ask for multiple tier of paid users, we want to have different operational for paid users.
Jessie add a nice support in multiple attributes to support such if

```javascript
// Middleware
if (args.length === 2 && req.user[args[0]] !== args[1]) {
    return res.send(403);
}
if (req.user.roles.indexOf(role) > -1) {
    return res.send(403);
}

// Endpoint
@authz('admin')
@authz('location', 'eu')
const Document = () => {
    ...
}
```

---

^The next feature that affect Jessie, was the addition of new attributes to the resources, as it now european users can access only to the european resources. Jessie started to feel the pain, the decorators model isn't work anymore, something should change in the endpoint level itself.

```javascript
// Middleware
if (typeof args[0] === 'object') {
    return AuthzDesicion(args[0])
}
if (args.length === 2 && req.user[args[0]] !== args[1]) {
    return res.send(403);
}
if (req.user.roles.indexOf(role) > -1) {
    return res.send(403);
}

// Endpoint
@authz('admin')
@authz('location', 'eu')
@authz({
    ...
})
const Document = () => {
    ...
}
```

---

^ This is not influenced by security, is influenced by implementation

# ~~Implement RBAC to an Application~~

^ Let's get a reminder in permissions model
^ There are 4 commoly used permissions models today, when we want to add AuthZ to application, we should be familiar with them and choose how to implement it with no matte rof the framework or tech stack we use.

## ACL - Access Control List

## RBAC - Role-Based Access Control

## ABAC - Attribute-Based Access Control

## ReBAC - Relationship-Based Access Control

---

^ ACL is the most simple model, it's a list of users and the resources they can access. It's usually implemented in the application level itself, and it's not scalable at all.
Not scalable, usually used in low-performance appliances

# ACL - Access Control List

[.column]
![inline](media/acl.png)

[.column]
* EOL model
* Widely used in IT systems/networks
* No segmentation/attribution support
* Hard to scale

[.header: alignment(left)]
# ABAC - Attribute Based Access Control

[.column]
![inline](media/abac.png)

[.column]
* The most robust model for inspection and desicion making
* Configuration could be hard
* Easy to handle multiple data sources
* üöÄ Highly scalable

^ ReBAC is the most scalable model, it's a list of roles and the resources they can access. It's usually implemented in the application level itself, and it's not scalable at all.

[.header: alignment(left)]
# ReBAC - Relationship Based Access Control

![inline](media/rebac.png)

[.column]
* Best fit for consumer-style applications
* Support in reverse indices and search for allowed data
* Easy to scale for users (>1b) hard in desicion's performance
* Expensive in management and maintainance


---

^ Althouh we influence the model, homebrowen is not enough because we should influence the DevEx. Independent decision code sample


```javascript
// Middleware
if (typeof args[0] === 'object') {
    return AuthzDesicion(args[0])
}
if (args.length === 2 && req.user[args[0]] !== args[1]) {
    return res.send(403);
}
if (req.user.roles.indexOf(role) > -1) {
    return res.send(403);
}

// Endpoint
@authz('admin')
@authz('location', 'eu')
@authz({
    ...
})
const Document = () => {
    ...
}
```

---

^ But a week after, a bug came, a user get access to a resource he is not aimed to.

![inline](media/sneaking.png)

---

^ Jessie was the first to analyze the bug and he discover that a user remove one of the decorator and do the check himself instead of using the framework.

```javascript
// Middleware
if (typeof args[0] === 'object') {
    return AuthzDesicion(args[0])
}
if (args.length === 2 && req.user[args[0]] !== args[1]) {
    return res.send(403);
}
if (req.user.roles.indexOf(role) > -1) {
    return res.send(403);
}

// Endpoint
@authz('admin')
const Document = () => {
    const enrichedUser = getSocialData(req.user);
    if (enrichedUser.lastGeolocation !== 'eu') {
        return;
    }
    ...
}
```

---

^ There is no way to deal with bad developers, but this is the actually the second (and maybe even mainly) problem we have with implementing authorization.
The mixing of policy code inside the application.

[.code-highlight: 15-19]
```javascript
// Middleware
if (typeof args[0] === 'object') {
    return AuthzDesicion(args[0])
}
if (args.length === 2 && req.user[args[0]] !== args[1]) {
    return res.send(403);
}
if (req.user.roles.indexOf(role) > -1) {
    return res.send(403);
}

// Endpoint
