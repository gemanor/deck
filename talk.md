^ Start with docker questienray
Who don't know what Docker is?
Is there somone who never run Docker command?
Everyone knows what is docker
Is it a public company?
Is it a decacorn?
Is it above 5b$?

^ To understand why docker fail in their GTM let's go back in 2013, the cloud start to grow in traditional companies
The cost of installations, VM, was cut together with the automate CI/CD

^ The problem that docker solved, is running everywhere I want it to work everywhere

![fit 100%](run_everywhere.jpeg)

---

^ The process of paying for installations, operations, integrations, reduced to zero. But docker inc. continued to do it

^ Docker model called open core, mean you're main IP is open and you buy license
Open core creates cannibilization. Selling software not as a service, is not just bad, it is worth when you cannibalize yourself

# open core

---

^ Other companies like MongoDB and Elastic, succeed with their open core because they we're always aware for the *service* they sell and not the license or the product.

^ Docker tried this approach too with Docker swarm, but failed as it was too late, too small, documented bad and, they haven't any deep pockets for cloud infrastructure to sell that service.

^ This is the reason why k8s took over, because google has the good operational infrastructure to promote it with their GCP offering.

---

^ What we can learn from that? Open core is dead. So what would work? Open Foundation, let me share our case there.

# ~~Open Core~~
# Open Foundation

---

^ This is the key for open foundation, open everything from your granular stuff.
How to do Open Foundation?
## Be Authentic
## Avoid conflicts of interest
## Make the project independent

---

^ Access control affect many apsects of the software development landscape. Application, Adminssion, Infrastructure, IT, Hardware

# Access Control

- Applications
- Admissions
- Infrastructure
- IT
- Hardware

---

^ Policy engine, is the trouble maker of every access control product, while the real value comes from other components of the software

[.header-strong: Avenir Next Regular, color(#9B5EE5)]

# **Data** > Decision > **Enforcement**

---

^ Open policy agent solved the problem with two components. Rego / Policy as Code and Agents.

[.header: alignment(left)]

[.column]
## Agent
![inline 70%](opa.png)

[.column]
## Policy as Code
```lua
allowed := {"customer", "admin"}

allow {
    every role in input.roles {
        role.name in allowed
    }
}
```

^ Open policy agent becomes a very popular among CNCF project and k8s admissions
